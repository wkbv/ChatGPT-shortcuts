# ChatGPT-shortcuts
-monkey userscript for more convenient use of the AI [ChatGPT](chat.openai.com)

**Note, that this is still a Î² version, it is likely not compatible with something somewhere, and may contain bugs.**

This script allows input of some commands into the text input to clear the chat and reset the thread, and more importantly, has shortcuts for initial prompts taken run-time mostly from [this repository](https://github.com/OliverMarcusson/ChatGPT-Fun), which includes several bypasses.

## Usage

This is a userscript for the -monkey family of userscript browser extensions, so you will need one of them ( like ViolentMonkey ).

### Commands:
```
-    !ls   : list commands
-    !r    : reset thread
-    !c    : clear messages without resetting
-    !mono : toggle global monospace font
```
### Prompts from this repo
```
-    !t    : a linux terminal emulation, running on a Bob's computer. English text input inside of {braces}
```
### Prompts from other sources

these may change at any time, so i will not list them here. the `!ls` command will provide an up-to-date list

## Note

Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for any actions taken on your OpenAI account due to the use of the prompts accessible trough this tool, or due to the use of this tool in general
